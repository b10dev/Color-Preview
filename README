	This was the first kivy app that I made under
the b10 name.  It was also the first app that I 
make with the Intel NUC.

On the desktop, I made a file named color.desktop.

In that file, I made the paths to the files.

After that, I had to go into the terminal and 
run the command:

chmod +x color.desktop

then, the file was executable.
